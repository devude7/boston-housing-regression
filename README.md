A boston housing regression project with a neural network built from scratch. The project contains several approaches, including:
- Non linear regression built from scratch using a neural network - backpropagation
- Non linear regression using PyTorch library 
- Non linear regression using TensorFlow library  

## Results
All of the approaches achieved similar results. The main objective of the project was to develop an artificial neural network from scratch to better understand what's happening behind the scenes, so to speak. The library approaches are meant to showcase how to build such architectures without underlying knowledge.

The data comes from: [KAGGLE - DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heptapod/uci-ml-datasets)
